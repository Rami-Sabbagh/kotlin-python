# jkpython
A JVM Python interpreter using Flex/Lex and Bison/Yacc.

Note: This is still WIP, it doesn't offer a lot of Python features yet, we cannot promise it will, contributions are welcome tho.

## Features
- Basic datatypes (numbers, strings, booleans, functions).
- Lists.
- Flow Control.
- Most arithmetic and logical operations.
- Some pre-built functions which are executed on the JVM directly.
